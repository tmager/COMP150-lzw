Format for statistics output:

Stats are output in plaintext as a CSV by the compressor, where each line
corresponds to the state after a code has been output. The lines are formatted
as follows, with all sizes measured in BITS:

<step>,<last input size>,<last code size>,<total input size>,<total code size>,
                <dictionary size>,<length of last dictionary entry added>

This last field is 0 if no new entry was added.
