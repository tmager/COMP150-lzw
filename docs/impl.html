    <h3>Implementation</h3>

    <p>
      All of the compression/decompression modes
      (see <a href="#CompressionModes">below</a>) are implemented by
      subclassing <kbd>Compressor</kbd> to provide the required low-level
      compression implementation. Each class provides both compression and
      decompression capabilities.

      The compressor and decompressor use a dictionary implemented as a trie for
      looking up the codes assigned to sequences of characters, combined with a
      vector of pointers into the trie for looking up character sequences based
      on codes.

      <h3>Compression Modes</h3>
    </a>
    <p>
      The compressor has several compression modes, all of them variants on the
      basic LZW algorithm. For the purposes of specifying which to use (see
      notes on <a href="source.html#Options">running the compressor</a>), each
      has an abbreviation, given in parentheses below.

      <!-- TODO: when lru/rlr are ready, mark as working -->

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Fixed code width, static dictionary</b> (<kbd>fs</kbd>): This is
          the simplest LZW variant; each code in the compressed output is the
          same width (traditionally 12 bits), and when the dictionary is full
          compression continues without adding any new entries to the
          dictionary.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Variable code width, static dictionary</b> (<kbd>vs</kbd>): Instead
          of all codes being the same width, the code width grows so as to be
          just large enough to uniquely identify all entries in the dictionary,
          up to some maximum. Once the code width has reached this maximum and
          all codes of that width have been used, no new entries are added to
          the dictionary.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Variable code width, least-recently-used leaf replacement</b>
          (<kbd>lru</kbd>): Operates the same way as variable code width, static
          dictionary, but dictionary entries are replaced once the dictionary
          fills up. The entry that is replaced is the leaf which has gone the
          longest without being used. An entry is "used" whenever it is touched
          by a search operation. <em>Not working yet</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Variable code width, rotating leaf replacement</b>
          (<kbd>rlr</kbd>): Works like least-recently-used replacement, but the
          entry to be replaced is selected from the leaves by searching the trie
          in order until it finds a leaf. The position that the search was at is
          maintained between replacements, ensuring that nodes are replaced
          throughout all of the leaves, not just the leaves near where the
          search starts. <em>Not working yet</em>
