      <h3>Obtaining and Building the Source Code</h3>
    </a>

    <p>
      The source code for the compressor, and the data analysis code, are
      available on
      GitHub <a href="https://github.com/tmager/COMP150-lzw">here</a>. Building
      the compressor requires <kbd>g++</kbd>; it has been tested with GCC 6.3,
      but should compile correctly on GCC 5. The analysis code requires Wolfram
      Mathematica, and has only been tested on Mathematica 11, though it should
      work with any reasonably recent version.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the source code has been acquired, move into the <kbd>src</kbd>
      directory and run <kbd>make</kbd>. This will create the <kbd>lzw</kbd>
      executable.
    </p>

    <a id="Options">
      <h3>Invocation and Options</h3>
    </a>
    
    <p>
      The <kbd>lzw</kbd> program should be invoked as follows:
      <div style="margin-left: 2em; margin-top: -.4em; margin-bottom: .6em">
        <kbd><b>lzw</b> [<i>OPTION</i>] <i>INFILE</i></kbd>
      </div>
      with the file being compressed or decompressed as <kbd>INFILE</kbd>. The
      possible options are:
      <ul class="options" style="margin-top: .1em">
        <li><span><kbd><b>-c</b></kbd></span>
          Compress mode; mutually exclusive with <kbd>-x</kbd>, with the last
          one to appear taking precedence. If neither is specified <kbd>-c</kbd>
          is taken to be the default.
        </li>

        <li><kbd><b>-i LOG_INTERVAL</b></kbd>
          <div>
            If compression statistics are being collected with the <kbd>-s</kbd>
            flag, sets the interval, in number of codes output, at which these
            statistics are stored. Defaults to 1.
          </div>
        </li>                

        <li><kbd><b>-m COMPRESSOR_MODE</b></kbd>
          <div>
            Sets the compression mode; see
            the <a href="modes.html#CompressionModes">modes list</a> for allowed
            settings and what they do. This option must be set the same way when
            decompressing a file as it was when the file was
            compressed. Defaults to <kbd>fs</kbd>.
          </div>
        </li>        
        
        <li><kbd><b>-o OUTPUT_FILE</b></kbd>
          <div>
            Specify file name of output. By default, when compressing this is
            the input file name with the compressor mode being used appended to
            it as an extension. When extracting, if such an extension is present
            it removes it and uses this as the filename; if not, it defaults to
            the input filename with <kbd>.extr_</kbd> and then the compressor
            mode as an extension.
          </div>
        </li>

        <li><kbd><b>-s STATS_FILE</b></kbd>
          <div>
            Specify a file to write compression statistics. Has no effect
            if <kbd>-x</kbd> is set. If this option is not used, compression
            statistics are ignored.
          </div>
        </li>

        <li><kbd><b>-w WIDTH</b></kbd>
          <div>
            Set the maximum code width for the compressor, in
            bits. <kbd>WIDTH</kbd> must be at least 9 and not more than 63. If
            unspecified, defaults to 12 bits. Must be set the same way when
            decompressing as when compressing.
          </div>
        </li>
        
        <li><span><kbd><b>-x</b></kbd></span>
          Extract mode; mutually exclusive with <kbd>-c</kbd>, with the last one
          to appear taking precedence.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Statistics File Format</h3>
    
    <p>
      The files generated with the <kbd>-s</kbd> flag above during compression
      are normal ASCII comma-separated values files. Each line corresponds to
      the state of the compressor after emitting a code. Note that in general
      all sizes are measured in bits. The columns represent, in order:

      <ul>
        <li>
          Step: the number of codes that have been emitted so far. Note that
          this is not the position in the input file, and for modes with
          variable-width codes it doesn't directly correspond to position in the
          output file either.
        </li>
        <li>
          Last input size: the number of bits represented by the code that was
          just emitted. For instance, if the code represented a sequence of 4
          characters, the last input size would be 32.
        </li>
        <li>
          Last code size: the number of bits in the last code that was emitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Total input size: the total number of input bits that have been
          compressed so far. If the statistics log interval is set to 1 (see
          the <kbd>-i</kbd> option above), this should equal the sum of all of
          the last input size entries so far.
        </li>
        <li>
          Total output size: the total number of bits that have been output into
          the compressed file so far. Again, if the statistics log interval is
          1, this should be the sum of all last code size entries so far.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dictionary size: the total number of entries in the dictionary so far,
          including all of the initial dictionary entires.
        </li>
        <li>
          Last dictionary entry size: the number of bits in the entry added to
          the dictionary when emitting the current code, or zero if no entry was
          added (for instance if the dictionary was full.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
